<h2>Exercise 1: Tic Tac Toe (60 points)</h2>

<p>
Write a program that plays Tic Tac Toe with the user.
When you start the program,
the player that goes first is randomly decided.
The following code shows how to do this.
</p>

<pre>
if (rand() % 2 == 0) {
   // User goes first.
} else {
   // Computer goes first.
}
</pre>

<p>
The program displays a 3 by 3 grid, which is initially blank.
As each player takes a turn, an X or and O is added to the grid.
</p>

<p>
After each turn, your code needs to check for a win or a tie.
If either of these conditions are met, then the program
displays the result and terminates.
</p>
