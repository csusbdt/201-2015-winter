<h1>Lab 1: The Command Line</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to work from the Linux command line.</li>
<li>Learn the difference between assembly language and C++.</li>
<li>Learn a simple approach to compile and run console programs written in C++.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>
To complete this lab, you need to have an account 
that enables you to log into the computers in JB 359.
The lab instructor will give you a username and password
or will explain how to get one. 
You can also log into computers in JB 358 with the same username and password.
</p>

<p>
You can also work on a lab computer from a remote computer.
See <a href="ssh.html">How to work remotely using SSH</a>
for instructions on how to do this.
</p>

<h2>Alternative Environments</h2>

<p>
If you have a Mac that runs OS X, 
you can do this assignment on your computer
because the commands covered in this lab are also available in OS X.
However, you will need to install Xcode to have access to a C++ compiler.
</p>

<p>
If you have access to a computer that runs the Linux operating system,
you will need to install the GNU C++ compiler if not already installed.
Try the following command to find out.
</p>

<pre>
c++ -v
</pre>

<p>
If the above command is not found,
then you need to install the GNU C++ compiler.
How you do this depends on your system.
If you have a GUI-based package manager,
you can use that.
If your system uses <code>yum</code>, then run the following.
</p>

<pre>
yum install gcc-c++
</pre>

<p>
If your system uses <code>apt-get</code>, then run the following.
</p>

<pre>
apt-get install gcc-c++
</pre>

<p>
There are also other possible ways
to install the Gnu C++ compiler,
which are not covered here.
</p>

<p>
If your personal computer is fast enough and has enough memory,
you can run an instance of Linux in a virtual machine
such as <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a>,
or you can set up your computer to dual boot into Windows or Linux.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, there are many ways to complete this and subsequent
assignments in this course.
It's up to you to decide.
If you're confused,
remember that the easiest way 
is to simply work in the labs (JB 358 or JB 359).
</p>

<h2>Learn How to Use a Text Editor</h2>

<p>
Log into a computer in JB 359 or other UNIX-based system
and practice creating files with one of the
text editors available on your system.
</p>

<p>
If you are working directly on a lab computer (not through SSH), 
then you can run programs that create windows, 
such as the text-editor called <em>gedit</em>. 
However, if you are working on a lab computer remotely (through SSH),
then you can not run programs that create windows, 
because the ssh program only gives you a text-based interface to the remote system.
In this case, you need to use a text editor
that runs inside a console window,
such as <em>vi</em> or <em>nano</em>.
</p>

<p class="callout">
A program that creates a window is said to have a graphical user interface (GUI).
In the early days of computers, GUIs did not exist,
so all interaction with the computer was through
character-based interfaces.
</p>

<p>
<em>Nano</em> is easier to understand than <em>vi</em>,
but <em>vi</em> is the traditional text editor that comes pre-installed
on practically all UNIX-like operating systems.
For this reason, <em>vi</em> is an important tool for system administrators.
</p>

<h2>Learn the Command Line Interface (15 points)</h2>

<p>
Use a search engine to find documentation and tutorials 
that help you understand the Linux command line interface.
(This is the same for OS X command line and other UNIX-based operating systems.)
</p>

<p>
Use your research skills to learn how to use the following Linux commands.
</p>

<pre>
pwd      # print working directory
cd       # change directory
ls       # list 
mkdir    # make directory
rmdir    # remove directory
mv       # move
cp       # copy
rm       # remove
</pre>

<p>
Also research how to use the following special characters in commands.
</p>

<pre>
.      # current directory
..     # parent directory
~      # home directory
</pre>

<p>
Log into a computer in JB 359 or other UNIX-based system
and practice using the above commands and special symbols.
</p>

<p>
One helpful feature of the terminal window
is called <em>command completion</em>.
If you press tab in the command line, the system will try to complete
what you are typing by looking for a matching filename.
</p>

<p>
Another helpful feature is called <em>command history</em>.
This feature allows you to access a record of commands that you previously entered.
Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the command history.
Press enter at any previously entered command to run it again.
</p>

<h2>Experience Working with C++ (15 points)</h2>

<p>
This section explains how to write, compile 
and run a simple C++ console program
from the Linux command line.
When the program runs, it prints <em>hello</em>.
</p>

<p>
Create a file named <em>hello.cpp</em>
with the following contents.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char * args[])
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "hello\n";
}
</pre>

<p>
From a terminal window, run the following command 
to compile <em>hello.cpp</em>.
</p>

<pre>
c++ hello.cpp
</pre>

<p>
The above command generates an executable file named <em>a.out</em>.
This will overrite the <em>a.out</em> file that you generated
from <em>hello.s</em>.
To run this file, issue the following from the command line.
</p>

<pre>
./a.out
</pre>

<p>
Modify the source code in <em>hello.cpp</em> 
so that it displays <em>Hello, Alice.</em>
Test that your changes produce an executable
file that runs as expected.
</p>

<!--
<h2>Experience Working with Assembly Language (10 points)</h2>

<p>
Read <a href="cpu.html">What is a computer</a> 
and compile and run the assembly language program described in it.
</p>

<p>
Modify the source code in <em>hello.s</em> 
so that it displays <em>Hello, Alice.</em>
Test that your changes produce an executable
file that runs as expected.
</p>
